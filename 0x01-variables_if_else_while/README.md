# C - Variables, if, else, while

This project focuses on learning the basics of C programming language, including variables, if-else statements, and while loops. It consists of several tasks that will help you understand and practice these concepts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain and use arithmetic operators, logical operators, and relational operators in C.
- Understand and implement if and if-else statements.
- Declare variables of different types (char, int, unsigned int) and assign values to them.
- Print the values of variables using printf.
- Utilize while loops to perform repetitive tasks.
- Gain familiarity with the ASCII character set.

## Tasks

0. **Positive anything is better than negative nothing**

   This task involves writing a program that assigns a random number to a variable and determines whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

1. **The last digit**

   In this task, you need to write a program that prints the last digit of a randomly assigned number and provides additional information based on the value of the last digit.

2. **I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**

   The task is to write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase using the `putchar` function.

3. **alphABET**

   Similar to the previous task, this program prints the alphabet in both lowercase and uppercase using the `putchar` function.

4. **When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**

   Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase but excludes the letters 'q' and 'e' using the `putchar` function.

5. **Numbers**

   This task involves writing a program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 using the `putchar` function.

6. **Numberz**

   Similar to the previous task, this program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 but without using any variable of type char.

7. **Smile in the mirror**

   Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse using the `putchar` function.

8. **Hexadecimal**

writing a program that prints all numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase using the `putchar` function.

9. **Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success**

Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space,Numbers should be printed in ascending order using puchar function

10. **Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**

Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a spaceThe two digits must be different using putchar function

11.**The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...**

Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
The three digits must be different
012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2
Print only the smallest combination of three digits
Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
You can only use putchar six times maximum in your code
You are not allowed to use any variable of type char

12. **Software is eating the World**

Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

The numbers should range from 0 to 99
The two numbers should be separated by a space
All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01
The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order
00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
You can only use putchar eight times maximum in your code
You are not allowed to use any variable of type char



## Getting Started

To compile and run the programs for each task, you can use the following commands:

```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 <filename.c> -o <output_filename>
./<output_filename>
Replace <filename.c> with the name of the C file for each task, and <output_filename> with the desired name for the compiled executable.

# Requirements
1.Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2.All files should end with a new line.
3.The code should be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
4.There should be no errors or warnings during compilation.
5.The code should follow the Betty style and pass the betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl checks.
