# 0x08. C - Recursion

This project folder contains C source files that demonstrate the concept of recursion in the C programming language. Each file corresponds to a specific function that utilizes recursion to solve a particular problem.
# Files

The project folder consists of the following files:
 # 0-puts_recursion.c
      This file contains a function that prints a string followed by a new line using recursion.

 #  1-print_rev_recursion.c
      This file contains a function that prints a string in reverse order using recursion.
      
 #  2-strlen_recursion.c
      This file contains a function that calculates and returns the length of a string using recursion.

 #    3-factorial.c 
      This file contains a function that calculates and returns the factorial of a given number using recursion.

 # 4-pow_recursion.c 
      This file contains a function that calculates and returns the value of x raised to the power of y using recursion.

 # 5-sqrt_recursion.c
      This file contains a function that calculates and returns the natural square root of a number using recursion.

 # 6-is_prime_number.c
      This file contains a function that checks whether a given integer is a prime number using recursion.

 # 100-is_palindrome.c 
      This file contains a function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome using recursion.

 # 101-wildcmp.c
      This file contains a function that compares two strings and determines if they can be considered identical, using wildcards, using recursion.

 #  _putchar.c
      This file contains the implementation of the _putchar function, which is used for character output.

 #  main.h
      This header file contains the function prototypes (declarations) for all the functions defined in the other files.

# How to Use

To use any of the functions defined in the files, follow these steps:

    Compile the source file(s) along with any other necessary files.
    Example: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o my_program

    Run the compiled program.
    Example: ./my_program

Note: Make sure to include the necessary header file(s) in your own program that intends to use these functions.
Example: #include "main.h"

# About

The C - Recursion project folder aims to provide examples and implementations of various recursive functions in the C programming language. These files serve as educational material for learning and understanding recursion concepts.
